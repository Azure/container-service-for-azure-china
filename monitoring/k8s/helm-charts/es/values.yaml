  # Client/ingest nodes can execute pre-processing pipelines, composed of

  # Data nodes hold the shards that contain the documents you have indexed. Data
  # nodes handle data related operations like CRUD, search, and aggregations.
  # These operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to
  # monitor these resources and to add more data nodes if they are overloaded.

  # The main benefit of having dedicated data nodes is the separation of the
  # master and data roles.
